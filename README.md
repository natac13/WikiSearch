## First Thing
```
npm install
```


If working with JavaScript file run: 
```
npm run wds
```
This starts a Webpack-dev-server to update when any file is changed.

If working with CSS and Sass then run in two terminals 
```
npm run launch
// other terminal
npm run build
// other terminal
gulp
```
This has a nodmon server that will reload and I will set up a gulpfile at some point to handle a livereload of the webpage itself.
