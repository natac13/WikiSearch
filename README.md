## First Thing
```
npm install
```


If working with JavaScript file run: 
```
npm run wds
```
This starts a Webpack-dev-server to update when any file is changed.

If working with CSS and Sass then run in two terminals 
```
npm run launch
// other terminal
npm run build
// other terminal
gulp
```
This has a nodmon server that will reload and I will set up a gulpfile at some point to handle a livereload of the webpage itself.

## What is this??

An Wikipedia search app that was a challenge from [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com/). This was one of the project required for the Front-end development certificate. I used React to build this app after getting an introduction from the [documentation's tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) and working through [Egghead.io Build Your First React App](https://egghead.io/series/build-your-first-react-js-application).

I will say things got pretty crazy due to React, Babel, and Javascript all upgrading in some way with changes to syntax and configuration. I even wrote a blog about the weekend starting on the Egghead tutorial. Your can find it [here](https://medium.com/@natac1311/the-weekend-i-choose-to-start-learning-react-fdeb4c11ab03#.t69kytzdp)
